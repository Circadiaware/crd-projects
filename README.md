# Circadian Rhythm Disorder Projects
**An overview of CRD-related projects that are currently being worked on.**

Anyone can [open an issue](https://github.com/Circadiaware/crd-projects/issues/new/choose) to add a CRD-related project they or another person are currently working on, for the purpose of keeping an overview of existing efforts. Only open-source softwares are accepted.

## Existing projects

These projects are being actively developed and already have a working implementation.

## Third-party projects

These open-source projects are developed by other developers outside of the Circadiaware initiative, we include them here as they can be relevant for sleep disorders management and sleep research:

## Draft projects

These projects are only drafts, there is no working implementation yet.

If you are interested in working on one of these, feel free to open an issue to start a collaboration, we will be happy to share more information.

Honorable mentions:

* [Medito](https://github.com/meditohq/medito-app) app (Android, iOS): open-source meditation app. We are convinced of the usefulness of meditation-based approaches for sleep issues, but if this interests you, at least this app is free and open-source.
